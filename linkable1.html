        <p>.     Javavscript is a language with many functionalities, it is used in designing, data
         handling, and is the third most in demand job in America. Through out this lesson I will 
         be explaining how javascript works and teach you some basic code. In this series I will be
        using a library called <a href="https://p5js.org/#" target="_blank">p5</a>. p5 is a very useful library
        . Javascript was invented by <a href="https://famouspeopletoday.com/brendan-eich/" target="_blank">Brendan Eich</a> 
        in 1996. </p>
